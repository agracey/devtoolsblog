# Map and Reviews of Cloud Native Tools

## Goals

Right now, there is a huge amount of tools for a developer looking to work with Cloud Native ideas (read: Kubernetes) and they are in various states of maturity. 

The goal for this blog is to give a place to learn more about these tools and see demos and reviews from a 3rd party. Each review needs to be similar enough to allow for fair like-to-like comparisons.




## TODO:

- [] Finish list of initial tools
- [] Figure out review aspects to include
- [] Common Features for each tool-type
- [] Set up demo environment
- [] Finish hugo template set up
- [] Publish



## How to Run

- Install Hugo
- Run `hugo serve -D`

OR

- `cf push -b hugo_buildpack --random-route` in the developer sandbox
