# Why do we need Developer Abstractions in Kubernetes?

I think it's fair to say that Kubernetes is designed for and by operators with minimal thought about how developers would use it. This means that there is a lot of operational and infrastructure knowledge needed to work with it effectively. I don't believe that developers should be required to also be operators just to build applications!

Several venders have made abstractions that can help a developer work effectively with Kubernetes without an in-depth background in maintaining infrastructure.
