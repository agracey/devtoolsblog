OpenTelemetry is a set of specifications, tools, and best practices for instrumenting code for observability. It was formed by OpenTracing and OpenCensus joining together and donating their work to the CNCF as a sandbox project.

# What is Observability?

Observability is all about exposing the inner structure of how data flows through a system to the people having to maintain the system. This can be exceedingly difficult in cloud native architectures as the data path can be across several components (likely maintained by several teams). When something goes wrong in the system, it's helpful to have ways of looking back at the path data took and the system state as errors occurred. 




## Metrics 

Metrics provide point-in-time snapshots of different measurements available to the application. These can be "consumables" (such as disk space, memory, cpu, file descriptors, etc...), or
