Buildah is a tool to build containers without needing the full Docker stack installed, running, and accessible. Due to this it can be run in a much more secure way and with more flexibility. 

It also allows more fine tuning of what goes into container images as well as running without needing root access to the build server.


# Experience
Like a few of the other tools here, I've used Buildah for a few years and use it as my main tool. As usual, I will try to be as unbiased as possible but please let me know if you believe I've missed (or ignored) anything by accident!

## Design

Buildah is part of the set of Open Source container tools that also contains CRI-O, Podman, and Skopeo. These all share common configuration and base libraries together to give a fully featured experience. 

There is some overlap between each tool in this set and it can be a little confusing as (for example) Podman is a complete drop-in replacement for docker on the command line so it can also build and manage container images.

Where Buildah stands out is in it's

# Review

## Prior knowledge needed

- Container Basics
- Shell Scripting


## Installation

Buildah is purely a command line tool for Linux and can be installed from both .rpm or .deb packages

### What privileges are needed to install / use

- Root on a Linux host to install

### Steps

As I'm running on an OpenSUSE Leap 15.2 system for my desktop, the installation is done simply with the zypper tool:

```bash 
sudo zypper install buildah
```

This will install the tool itself. 

If you want to run rootless (allows building containers without needing to run `sudo` before each command), you need to edit two files:

```bash
sudo echo `whoami`:10000:100000 >> /etc/subuid
sudo echo `whoami`:10000:100000 >> /etc/subgid
```

This change also affects the full [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io), [Podman](podman.io), and [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) toolchain as well to allow for a fully rootless and more secure way of building and running containers!
