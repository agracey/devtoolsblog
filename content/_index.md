# Purpose

In the Cloud Native world, the landscape of what a software engineer needs to know has exploded in the last few years and has become increasingly complex. We have seen an explosion in tools available for our operator friends but developers have been left behind.

I will be posting reviews of tools geared at helping developers get back to what we do best: write interesting code!

Every week (or every other sometimes), I will pick a tool from the map below to review. I will record a "First Look" video of me reading through the github readme to install and run the samples; I will learn a bit about the tool offline then use it with a sample project (on stream); and lastly I will post a review of the tool on this blog. 


# Tools Map

I really like the [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) but it's too cluttered with infrastructure tools that a developer shouldn't need to know (or care) about. 

{{<tools-map >}}

If you know of a tool that should be here, please let me know in the [SUSE Community](https://community.suse.com) or open up a issue in Github.
