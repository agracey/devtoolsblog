# Purpose of this Series

In the Cloud Native world, the landscape of what a software engineer needs to know has exploded in the last few years and has become increasingly complex. We have seen an explosion in tools available for our operator friends but developers have been left behind.

In this blog series, I will be reviewing tools geared at helping developers get back to what we do best: write interesting code!

Each week (or every other when needed), I will pick a tool from the map below to write a review and record a demo of something that differentiates it from other options. As I go, I'll edit this page to show the most recent list of blog entries.


Note that this is very much a continual work in progress and as I get feedback and learn, I'll try to update all of the entries with new formats. 

# Tools Map

## Why not just use the published CNCF Landscape?

I went back and forth on this if I should or not. I think there's a lot of value in the CNCF landscape but it's too overly complex for programmers when not already familiar with Kubernetes and it's ecosystem. 

The goal here is to try to pull out the specific pieces and options that a developer (or team of developers) would need to know in a way that is accessible without the larger infrastructure background.

## Contributing

If you know of a tool that should be here, please let me know in the [SUSE Community](https://community.suse.com) (Once it is live!) or open up a issue in Github.

Also, if there's anything that's not clear in any of these reviews or I'm making any mistaken assumptions, please let me know! Either in a Github ticket or (preferably) by posting in the [SUSE Community](https://community.suse.com)
